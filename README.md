Impurity reveals distinct operational phases in quantum thermodynamic cycles : Wolfram Mathematica code 
The file named "strength stroke wise .nb" is a mathematica file which containts code to generate the density plots when we vary strength of the impuirty in weak coupling.
Following are few subtleties of the code: ENE6 variable defines the weak coupling energy eigenvalue as derived analytically in the paper. ZA6 is the corresponding partition function. <br />

atc,ath are Cold and Hot reservoir temperatures respectively.
k is the boltzman constant, asth and astc are (f_h and f_c) the values of strength during strokes CB and DA respectively.

# Logic of the code:
We calculate the work of quantum Otto cycle by using the "Sum" function of mathematica and plot it using "DensityPlot" function.
